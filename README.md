### FarmArt : The App
- Our platform FarmArt connects farmers with people, where farmers can add their products online and people can add them to their basket, ranging from farm produce to land available for lease.

- You can signin/signup as a farmer or as a customer. Built with RESTful API architecture and CRUD functionality. 

### Motivation
Build a fullstack app that uses Ruby for the backend with PostgreSQL and React for the frontend.  



### Technical details
- **PostgreSQL** database.
- Authentication with **JWT**.
- Developed a **Ruby on Rails** API backend with 5 different endpoints: for users, farmers, customers, products and categories.
- Used **serializer** to format the JSON file.
